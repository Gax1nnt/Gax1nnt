## About Me:

Hi everyone! If you try to describe me in a couple of words, you can say: Young, motivated guy who is always ready to come to the rescue! These are the qualities I give myself, and so do not only me, but also people with whom I am constantly communicating. I have quite a lot of experience in validating nodes of various projects, and in general I web3 for quite a long time. I really like the idea of decentralization because it's safe for your own data! Let's develop it together! Please check out my whole profile, I think you can find a lot of interesting things here).
